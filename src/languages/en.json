	"why": "I believe we are at a breaking point.\n\n Whether this period is as revolutionary as the emergence of the internet, time will tell. But in any case, we are living through a transition of cycles. Access has changed. Today, those who seek, walk, and find.\n\n I see less and less space for those who execute compared to those who imagine. Good winds to the enthusiasts.\n\n I believe in technology as a powerful tool for creating the world we want to live in. I believe in the community, in open source, and in the technologists who create. Out of curiosity, out of devotion to making reality happen.\n\n From intelligence, create solutions.\n From data, understand better and generate even more questions to be answered.\n Create value.\n\n I program things that seek to make a better reality.\n Others not so much, but are at least curious.\n\n I can leverage you with AI, data, web, front-end, back-end, net, design, ideation, prototyping, physical devices, and perhaps even other things.\n\n If it makes sense, get in touch above. Maybe we can do something cool together.\n\n All the best, thank you for coming this far.",
