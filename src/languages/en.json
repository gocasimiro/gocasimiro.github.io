	"why": "Because I'm really tired of all the complexity that the web has become. I truly cheer and hope for the day when simple things can make a significant impact. It's not part of my work ethic to deal with all the nonsense we are exposed to. I rather believe that thereâ€™s still room for people who create things directly from the heart. Who use technology to improve people's lives and try to make this world a better and fairer place to live. Doing it this way is a manifesto of how I believe things should be: accessible, democratic, straightforward, and simplified in their essence. If this made sense to you, feel free to reach out. Maybe we can create something together. May your life be filled with happiness. Thank you for coming this far.",
