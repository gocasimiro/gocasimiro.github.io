	"why": "Because I'm really tired of all the complexity that web development has become.\n\n Tired of frameworks that don't solve real needs and of hype.\n\n I really hope and long for the day when simple things can once again have a significant impact, when developers can go back to creating solutions rather than just going in circles.\n\n All this bureaucracy and difficulty we're exposed to is not part of my work ethic.\n\n I prefer to believe that there's still room for people who create things that come directly from the heart. Who use technology to improve the lives of their own, their community, and try to make this world a better and fairer place to live.\n\n Making something as personal as my presentation in this way is a manifesto of how I believe things should be: accessible, democratic, straight to the point, and simplified in their essence.\n\n If this made sense to you, get in touch. Maybe we can do something together.\n\n May your life be filled with happiness. Thank you for coming this far.",
